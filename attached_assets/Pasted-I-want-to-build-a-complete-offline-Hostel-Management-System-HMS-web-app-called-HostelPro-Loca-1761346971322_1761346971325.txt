I want to build a complete **offline Hostel Management System (HMS)** web app called "HostelPro Local" using Node.js, Express, React (Vite), and SQLite.

⚙️ Here’s exactly what I want:

1. **Architecture**
   - Monorepo style: a backend (Node.js + Express + SQLite) and a frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind).
   - The backend should run on port 5000 and the frontend on port 5173.
   - Both should communicate using REST APIs (Axios).

2. **Backend**
   - Use Express with routes for:
     - `/api/auth` (login, register)
     - `/api/rooms`
     - `/api/tenants`
     - `/api/payments`
     - `/api/staff`
     - `/api/maintenance`
     - `/api/reports`
     - `/api/settings`
   - Store data in a local `database.sqlite` file using **better-sqlite3**.
   - Add folder structure:
     ```
     backend/
       src/
         config/
         controllers/
         routes/
         models/
         utils/
     ```
   - Each route should connect to a matching controller (CRUD structure).
   - Include a test route like `/api/rooms` that returns sample data to confirm setup works.

3. **Frontend**
   - Use React with Vite and Tailwind CSS.
   - Create pages: Dashboard, Tenants, Rooms, Payments, Staff, Reports, Settings.
   - Add a left sidebar navigation + topbar header.
   - Each page should fetch data from `http://localhost:5000/api/...` endpoints.
   - Use Axios for API calls.

4. **Database Schema (SQLite)**
   Create tables:
   - `users (id, username, password, role)`
   - `rooms (id, room_no, capacity, price, occupied, notes)`
   - `tenants (id, name, phone, email, room_id, join_date, leave_date, status, id_doc)`
   - `payments (id, tenant_id, amount, month, method, status, created_at)`
   - `staff (id, name, role, phone, salary, joined_at)`
   - `maintenance (id, room_id, issue, date_reported, status, remarks)`
   - `settings (key, value)`

5. **Authentication**
   - Local JWT-based login system.
   - Role-based access (Admin and Staff).

6. **Extras**
   - Add a sample dashboard page showing dummy statistics.
   - Include a README.md explaining how to run both frontend and backend locally.
   - Make sure all code is **runnable on Replit**.
   - Once done, I’ll download the entire project and run it locally offline.

🎯 Goal:
Build a clean, modular, and extendable base project that I can later customize into a complete hostel management desktop/web software.
