Please add a complete "Add New Customer (Tenant)" feature to the existing HostelPro Local project.

Here’s exactly what I need:

1. **Backend (Node.js + SQLite)**
   - Create a new POST route at `/api/tenants/add` that accepts JSON data for adding a new tenant (customer).
   - It should save all the following fields into the `tenants` table:
     - name
     - mobile_number
     - cnic
     - father_name
     - father_cnic
     - room_number
     - rent
     - join_date
     - status (Active, Left, etc.)
   - Validate required fields before saving.
   - Return a success message and the saved tenant data in JSON.
   - Example JSON:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "Ali Khan",
       "mobile_number": "03123456789",
       "cnic": "35202-1234567-1",
       "father_name": "Ahmed Khan",
       "father_cnic": "35202-9876543-2",
       "room_number": "A12",
       "rent": 12000,
       "join_date": "2025-10-24",
       "status": "Active"
     }
     ```

2. **Frontend (React + Tailwind)**
   - Create a new page or modal form named **Add Customer** under the “Tenants” section.
   - The form should include input fields:
     - Full Name
     - Mobile Number
     - CNIC
     - Father’s Name
     - Father’s CNIC
     - Room Number (dropdown or input)
     - Rent Amount
     - Join Date (date picker)
     - Status (dropdown: Active / Left / Pending)
   - Add a **Submit** button that sends data via Axios POST to `/api/tenants/add`.
   - Show a success message or alert once the tenant is added successfully.
   - Clear the form after submission.

3. **Database**
   - Update the `tenants` table if needed to include these new columns:
     - father_name
     - father_cnic
     - rent
     - room_number
   - Ensure data is saved properly into SQLite.

4. **Testing**
   - After submitting the form, confirm the new tenant appears when fetching all tenants from `/api/tenants`.
   - If possible, show it in the tenant list page or console log for now.

Goal:
I want a working form and backend endpoint that lets me add a new customer (tenant) with all the above details, store it in the database, and confirm the data is saved successfully.
