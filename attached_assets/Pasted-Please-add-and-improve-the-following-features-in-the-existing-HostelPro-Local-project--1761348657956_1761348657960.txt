Please add and improve the following features in the existing HostelPro Local project:

---

## 1. 🏠 Room Management Feature
Add a complete system for managing rooms because every hostel has different room names or numbers.

### Backend:
- Create a new table called `rooms` if it doesn’t already exist.
  Columns:
  - id
  - room_name (e.g., A1, Deluxe-2, etc.)
  - capacity
  - price
  - status (Available, Occupied, Maintenance)
- Add routes:
  - `POST /api/rooms/add` → to add new rooms
  - `GET /api/rooms` → to get all rooms
  - `PUT /api/rooms/:id` → to edit room info
  - `DELETE /api/rooms/:id` → to delete room
- When adding a new tenant, the room should be selectable from the list of rooms.

### Frontend:
- Add a "Rooms" page under sidebar.
- Show a list of existing rooms with columns: Room Name, Capacity, Price, Status.
- Include a form or modal to **Add Room**, **Edit Room**, and **Delete Room**.
- When a tenant occupies a room, that room’s status automatically changes to "Occupied". When the tenant leaves, mark it as "Available".

## 2. 🏢 Custom Hostel Name and Logo
Allow hostel owners to change the app’s displayed name and logo according to their business.

### Backend:
- Add a table or use existing `settings` table to store:
  - hostel_name
  - logo_path (optional)
- Add routes:
  - `GET /api/settings`
  - `PUT /api/settings/update` → to update name or logo

### Frontend:
- In the “Settings” page, add fields:
  - Hostel Name (e.g., “Bilawal Hostel”)
  - Upload Logo (optional)
- Display the custom hostel name and logo on the top navbar or sidebar (replacing the current “Hostel Manager” name).

## 3. 💰 Mark as Paid System
Add a proper rent/payment status system.

### Backend:
- In the `payments` table, make sure there is a `status` column (`Paid`, `Pending`).
- Add route:
  - `PUT /api/payments/:id/mark-paid` → updates the payment status to "Paid".
- At the beginning of each new month (1st date), automatically reset all payment statuses to “Pending” again (this can be triggered manually via a “Reset Payments” button).

### Frontend:
- On the Payments page, show each tenant’s payment status.
- Add a **“Mark as Paid”** button next to each tenant’s record.
- When clicked, it updates status to “Paid” (green badge).
- Add a **“Reset All Payments”** button (only visible to admin) that marks all back to “Pending”.
- Display total paid and pending amounts on dashboard.

---

## 4. 🇵🇰 Currency Setup (PKR)
Change all currency symbols to **PKR (₨)** instead of dollars.

### Backend:
- Update all rent and amount-related fields to show PKR.

### Frontend:
- Replace all "$" signs with "₨".
- Dashboard totals, room rent, and payment reports should all display PKR consistently.

---

✅ **Summary:**
1. Add Room Management (add/edit/delete rooms with flexible names).
2. Add Custom Hostel Name + Logo option in Settings.
3. Add Mark as Paid + Reset Payment Status system.
4. Change all currency displays to PKR (₨).

The goal is to make the app more realistic and customizable for local hostels like “Bilawal Hostel” and others.
